# Spaceship
I tried to recreate my favorite atari game : Asteroids. It is still in some kind of "early acces". I might try to add some extra features but I think I will keep it the way it is. The game was a complete hit for me, just the way it was.

# How to install ?
You only have to make a folder. This folder should inculde the .pde file and the .png file. They have to be in the same folder because if they don't the program won't work. It isn't very hard, anyone should be able to do it.
